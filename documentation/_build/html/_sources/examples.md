When you run the program, it will say:
```

You can either enter "employee" or "manager" to go into those modes. Let's start with employee.
```

```
Please choose a function by typing the corresponding number:

You can record your shift or record a stock number. Here is an example with the first.
```

Please enter the start time of your shift. Format should be military time with no colon.

```
Please enter the hour you would like to see shift overlaps for as a whole number:
